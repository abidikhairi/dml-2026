# Global Climate "Anomaly" Tracker

## Context
Scientists have been recording temperatures for over 150 years, but the raw data is inherently chaotic. Between extreme seasonal swings, sensor malfunctions in the 19th century, and geographic gaps, identifying a global trend is like trying to hear a whisper in a crowded stadium.

In this lab, your team will step into the roles of climate researchers to determine if the "warming" reported in the media is a statistical fluke or a clear, measurable trend hidden within the noise.

## Goal
The primary objective is to extract a clear "Signal" from "Noise." Your group will process historical temperature logs to calculate and visualize the Climate Anomaly—the specific deviation from a historical baseline—to demonstrate how data smoothing (rolling averages) changes our perception of long-term trends.
