# E-Commerce Behavioral Forensics: Case Study Olist

## Context
In the hyper-competitive world of online retail, every click, every dollar spent, and every second of delivery time is tracked. Companies like Amazon or eBay don't just sell products; they sell optimized experiences. However, raw transaction logs are often messy, containing everything from cancelled orders to bizarrely expensive outliers.

Your group acts as a forensic data team tasked with finding the hidden patterns—and the hidden leaks—in a retail giant's operations.

## Goal
The objective is to transform a massive list of individual sales into a Behavioral Report.

Your group will identify which types of customers drive the most profit, which days of the week are most "efficient," and whether expensive shipping actually results in higher customer satisfaction.
