# The Happiness vs. Reality Correlation

## Context
Does money actually buy happiness? Governments and NGOs use the "World Happiness Report" to guide policy, but that data is meaningless without the context of a nation's "Reality"—its GDP, its life expectancy, and its level of freedom.

This project challenges your group to perform a cross-organizational analysis, reconciling data from the United Nations with economic indicators from the World Bank to see what truly makes a society thrive.

## Goal
The objective is to provide deep insights into the relationship between economic growth and national happiness. Your group will determine if wealth is a guaranteed driver of satisfaction or if there is a "diminishing return" where further economic growth fails to increase human well-being.

By the end of this study, you should be able to identify "Outlier Nations"—countries that are exceptionally happy despite lower GDP, or wealthy nations that remain unexpectedly unhappy.
